### Application Overview

An app that suggests recipes to parents of fussy eaters, based on two choices; 1 ingredient that their child likes to eat, and 1 ingredient that the parents want them to eat. This was a group project with one other developer.

### Instructions

1. The Eat Something homepage displays an image and a navbar, and takes you through to choose your ingredients page via a button. There are also options to register and log in via the navbar links.

2. Once on the ingredients index page, a user can select two ingredients, and then submit their choices. This will redirect them to the recipe show page.

3. Once on the recipe show page, the user can see information on the chosen recipe, which combines both chosen ingredients. There is an image, nutrition information on both ingredients, the other ingredients needed, and the method. There is also an option to comment on the recipe in a comments form, and these comments are displayed at the bottom of the page in the comments feed.

4. Users can register from the Register page and login on the login page. Users must provide a unique email address and matching password/password confirmation.

5. Once logged in, users are redirected back to the homepage. There will now be an option to visit their profile page in the navbar.

6. Once on their profile page users can see their avatar, details, message form, and their inbox. Here the user has the option to send a message to another user, by selecting that user from the dropdown menu. These messages will show up in the inbox of that other users profile page.

## Process

This was a project with one other developer, [Gessica Santoro](https://github.com/Gessy90). We used Trello to manage the project and performed daily standups. Features were created on separate git branches before being merged into the development branch.

We started the project by planning our models and database structure. We did some pair coding to set up the basics.

We then worked on setting up the seeds file, so that we had some data to work with on the front end.

Once the serve side code was working and had been tested by making API requests with Insomnia, then we moved onto creating the frontend using React. We divide up the components and Gessica worked on the Register and Log in forms while I worked on the ingredients index and Recipe show pages. We later added the user profile page, which we both worked on.

We worked on adding some extra features such as commenting on recipes, and internal messaging from user to user.

We used Bulma and SCSS for the styling of the site. We used our wireframes throughout the process, to which some changes were made as we worked.

### Challenges

The logic involved in getting the page to redirect to a specific recipe based on the two ingredients chosen was a challenge.

Setting up the database was also a challenge as were new to working with database relationships, as was working in Python, a language we had only just learned.

Internal messaging was also a challenge.

### Wins

We worked really well together as a team, especially pair coding, which was very productive. We organised our time well, with the use of Trello, daily stand-ups and prioritisation of features.

Internal messaging was a win, as this was quite a challenge to get working.

## Future features

We would like to make the site more mobile responsive.

We would like to add an external API for the nutrition information on eahc ingredient. We found one called Edamam which would be perfect for this, and would enable us to cut the size of our seeds file in half.

We would like to add a search bar as an alternate option, that would enable you to choose two ingredients.

We would also like to add a delete function on the messages and comments.
