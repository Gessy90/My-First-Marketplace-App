### Application Overview

## Process
The first thing that I did was to install Expo and get familiar with it. I started to run the app on my iOS device so that I could view the progress of what I was building in real time. The first pages that I created are the WelcomeScreen and the ViewImageScreen. In these pages I added few components like the Button Component, Card Component and the ListItem Component. After that I moved onto creating the AccountScreen and the ListingScreen. The forms were made easy to build by using Formik and the validation was done by implementing Yup. At the end of Part 1 I made few improvemts to my code by adding some text and some chevrons to the MessagesScreen and by refactoring a part of my code. This is still a work in progress so please bare with me.


### Challenges

I encountered few errors that I didn't know how to resolve, but by reading the error messages carefully I managed to find a solution at the end.

### Wins

I have created a new application from scratch and I'm very proud of the end result. 

## Future features

This is still a work in progress and I will complete Part 2 of the course shortly.
